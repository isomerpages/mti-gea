Singapore is currently in the midst of negotiating a GEA with Australia. To support the Singapore government in negotiations with Australia on the GEA, we would be interested to hear from industry stakeholders. This will comprise three main avenues, including targeted consultations, written submissions that can be sent to [feedback@gea.gov.sg](feedback@gea.gov.sg) and a [questionnaire](https://form.gov.sg/#!/6267c77f2ca9400012569ea6/preview) that has been prepared. 

For inputs pertaining to green goods, we would like to request companies to respond to this [questionnaire](https://form.gov.sg/61d29e61369b3a0013ccaafb) instead.

In particular, we would be interested to hear from you regarding your businessesâ€™ interests in the green economy and how a GEA could better facilitate green trade and growth. 

The closing date for submissions in the first tranche of feedback is 30 May 2022, and thereafter on a continual basis.
