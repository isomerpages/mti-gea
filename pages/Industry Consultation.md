The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment conducted a series of direct consultations with companies across the full range of areas in the Green Economy Agreement (GEA) to understand more about their interests in the GEA.

We will continue efforts to further strengthen and develop the Singapore-Australia GEA. We will also continue implementing joint initiatives and projects under the agreement to secure tangible benefits for both sides.

We invite industry stakeholders to join us in advancing international cooperation in the green economy. Should you wish to provide feedback or views, written submissions can be sent to [feedback@gea.gov.sg](feedback@gea.gov.sg).
