The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment organised three roundtables featuring 28 companies from Singapore and Australia. Ministries also met 14 other companies to understand more about their interests in the Green Economy Agreement.

Singapore has recently concluded its GEA with Australia. However, work on projects and joint initiatives continue. 

To support the Singapore government in negotiations with Australia on the GEA, we would be interested to hear from industry stakeholders. Should you wish to provide feedback or views, written submissions that can be sent to [feedback@gea.gov.sg](feedback@gea.gov.sg).
