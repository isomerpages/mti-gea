<p align = justify> GEAs can remove non-tariff barriers to trade in green goods and services. This will help reduce regulatory burdens on businesses and increase access to green goods and services in both Singapore’s and our partner countries’ markets. 

<p align = justify> GEAs will also foster rules and standards that promote cross-border green activities and support the development and commercialisation of green technologies. This will promote conducive environments for businesses and research institutes to engage with overseas partners, access green opportunities abroad and translate novel solutions to applications at scale. 

<p align = justify> We hope to generate practical benefits to the real economy and workforce by catalysing business and commercial opportunities, intergovernmental and public-private partnerships, and job creation in sustainable sectors, as the world transits to sustainable and low carbon growth.

<p align = justify> Developing a network of GEAs with like-minded international partners will also contribute to the global discourse on trade and the environment and strengthen global capacity to address climate change.
